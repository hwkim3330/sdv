## About SDV/T 001-2022 Standard

### Part 1: Atomic Service API Interface
The Atomic Service API provides standardized functional interfaces for application developers, containing 290+ APIs across six key domains:

- **BCM (Body Control Module)**: Vehicle body control functions
- **TMS (Thermal Management System)**: Temperature and climate control
- **VCS (Vehicle Control System)**: Vehicle motion control
- **EMS (Energy Management System)**: Power and energy management
- **ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems)**: Intelligent driving features
- **HMI (Human Machine Interface)**: User interaction interfaces

### Part 2: Device Abstraction API Interface
The Device Abstraction API provides hardware abstraction layers, containing 230+ APIs across five domains:

- **BCM**: Body control hardware devices
- **TMS**: Thermal management devices
- **PWT (Powertrain)**: Powertrain components
- **CHS (Chassis)**: Chassis systems
- **ADAS**: Sensor and actuator interfaces

## Key Features of the Standard

### 4-Layer Architecture
1. **Application Layer**: User experience and vehicle-specific features
2. **Atomic Service Layer**: Standardized functional units (Part 1)
3. **Device Abstraction Layer**: Hardware control interfaces (Part 2)
4. **Foundation Platform Layer**: OS and basic computing environment

### Strategic Significance
- Led by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) Software Division
- Participation from 60+ companies including BYD, GWM, Geely, FAW, SAIC, Huawei, Bosch, Continental, Baidu
- Aims to establish a unified development standard and build China's own SDV ecosystem

## Key Insights

### Technical Achievements
- Comprehensive coverage of vehicle functions through 520+ APIs
- Complete separation of hardware and software (HW-SW decoupling)
- Significant improvement in development efficiency
- Implementation of automotive "app store" model

### Strategic Implications
- New dimension in global standardization competition
- Securing leadership in software ecosystem
- Accelerating automotive industry paradigm shift
- Reshaping technological competitiveness between nations

## Recommendations for Korean SDV Standard

### Proposed Directions
1. **Core API + Extension Profiles**: Standardize only core APIs, add extensions via profiles
2. **International Compatibility**: Provide mapping tables with AUTOSAR, ISO 20078, W3C VISS
3. **Built-in Security/OTA**: Mandatory authentication, authorization, encryption; OTA update APIs
4. **Vehicle-Service Integration**: Define APIs for MaaS, C-ITS, cloud integration, V2X data sharing

### Strategic Response
- Accelerate K-SDV standardization consortium
- Strengthen cooperation with global standards (AUTOSAR, SOAFEE)
- Build OEM-IT-Tier1 collaboration ecosystem
- Develop SDV specialist workforce
